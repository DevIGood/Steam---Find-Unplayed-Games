## About

Most of us have a vast Steam library with games that will never be played.
This is just a thing that i created to force myself to play games in my Steam library.

## Running the program

You will need to get your own Steam API and Steam ID.

Steam API can be aquired [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) and Steam ID can be found on your profile page in the URL.

## How to use

1) Edit the data.json file and put your **Key** and **mySteamID**.

2) Run the **Update list** option atleast ones for other functions to work.
